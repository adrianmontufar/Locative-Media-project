Night Walking is a series of sound pieces that combine field recordings of nighttime walks with a spatialized sonification of the streetlights and other nighttime illumination I encounter during those walks.

At this time, you can find the first example of these sound pieces in Documentation under the name "Walk2_mixdown.aif"

You will also find the original audio tracks and a 30-second video monitoring the "virtual position" of the streetlights in relation to my walking trajectory.
